Why Spring Security?
1.user name /password authentication.
2.SSO/Okta/LDAP
3.APP Level Authorization
4. Intra APP Authorization like OAuth
5.Microservic Secutiry using Token,JWT
6.Method level Security.


1.Authentication(who are you) :--> Userid password verification (Knowledge based authentication).
Advantage:Easy to implement and use
Disadvantage:- Not so safe what if someone steal/find out password.

Overcome this we have possession based authentication:
Phone/text message
key cards and bagdes
access token device

We can have combination of botg Knowledge as well as possession based authentication. This is also known as Multi Factor Authentication.


2.Authorization(can user do this?):

3. Principal: currently logged in user.(for example user can have multiple gmail account)

 4. How does authorization happen?
-> using Granted Authority


5. Role: Group of authorities(are coarse rained)
